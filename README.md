The bmf_ChannelStrip is a "Channel Strip" style plugin featuring input trim control, 3-band parametric EQ, compressor with attack and release controls, and a reverb with pre-delay and absorption (diffusion) control. 

This plugin works great as parallel processing. Try it on a send for your drum bus! You can shape, squash, and smear to your liking.
